## Welcome to the NBG League!
The goal for the NBG League is for the user to be able to create his or her own league with teams and players while being able to keep track of those teams. The user can also use different log in to for different sport teams or whatever the user so choses.</h3>

## Technologies Used
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Mongoose
- **Frontend**: EJS
- **Utilities**: bcrypt, dotenv, express-session, method-override, morgan

## Next Steps
1. **Styling**: Creating a spot in the code to have players on a the correct team page.
2. **Styling**: Creating options for the user to add photos to the teams created.
3. **Bug Fixes**: Fix issue with editing player or team instead of doubling entry.
